## Random Forest NBA Win-Lose Prediction 

* This repository contains only the code that shows data cleaning process for the dataset obtained from AWS Data Exchange. 

* You can see the html version of the notebook below:

* [nba_win_lose_predict.html](https://dbogatic.github.io/nba_win_predict/nba_win_lose_predict.html)



* The original dataset contained play-by-play stats for NBA games during seasons 2002-2016.

* Because of the enormous amount of data (over 8 million rows by 346 columns) that was in these datasets, it was impossible to upload to GitHub that allows up to 100mb file sizes. 

* Also, only the handful of features I thought were relevant for prediction were included in the model. 

 * For this reason, I have uploaded the html version of the code. If you wish to test the code and to do your own analysis you can obtain these datasets for free at [AWS Data Exchange](https://aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/) by Stats Perform.
