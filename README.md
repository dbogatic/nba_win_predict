## Random Forest NBA Win-Lose Prediction 

* This repository contains only the code that shows data cleaning and analysis process for the dataset obtained from AWS Data Exchange. 

* The original dataset contained play-by-play stats for NBA games during seasons 2002-2016.

* Because of the enormous amount of data (over 8 million rows by 326 columns) that was in these datasets, it was impossible to upload to GitHub that allows up to 100mb file sizes. 

* Also, only the handful of features I thought were relevant for prediction were included in the model. 

 * For this reason, I have uploaded the html version of the code. If you wish to test the code and to do your own analysis you can obtain these datasets for free at [AWS Data Exchange](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dataexchange/home?region=us-east-1#/products/prodview-7kigo63d3iln2) by Stats Perform.
